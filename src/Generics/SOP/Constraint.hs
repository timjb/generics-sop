-- | Require a constraint for every element of a list.
--
-- If you have a datatype that is indexed over a type-level
-- list, then you can use 'All' to indicate that all elements
-- of that type-level list must satisfy a given constraint.
--
-- /Example:/ The constraint
--
-- > All Eq '[ Int, Bool, Char ]
--
-- is equivalent to the constraint
--
-- > (Eq Int, Eq Bool, Eq Char)
--
-- /Example:/ A type signature such as
--
-- > f :: All Eq xs => NP I xs -> ...
--
-- means that 'f' can assume that all elements of the n-ary
-- product satisfy 'Eq'.

-- If you have a datatype that is indexed over a type-level

--
-- /Example:/ The constraint

--
-- > (Eq Int, Eq Bool, Eq Char)

-- NOTE:
--
-- The definition
--
-- type All2 f = All (All f)
--
-- is more direct, but has the unfortunate disadvantage the
-- it triggers GHC's superclass cycle check when used in a
-- class context.

-- | Composition of constraints.
--
-- Note that the result of the composition must be a constraint,
-- and therefore, in @f ':.' g@, the kind of @f@ is @k -> 'Constraint'@.
-- The kind of @g@, however, is @l -> k@ and can thus be an normal
-- type constructor.
--
-- A typical use case is in connection with 'All' on an 'NP' or an
-- 'NS'. For example, in order to denote that all elements on an
-- @'NP' f xs@ satisfy 'Show', we can say @'All' ('Show' :. f) xs@.
